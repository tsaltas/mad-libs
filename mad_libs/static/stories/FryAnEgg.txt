How to Fry Eggs
Shannon
For sunny-side-up eggs, start with a hot skillet on medium heat. Swirl in a little butter. Crack the eggs into individual bowls. This way you can inspect for broken shells and yolks. Add the eggs side by side in the pan. In about a minute, the outer edges will turn opaque. This is your cue to cover the pan and lower the heat. Wait 4 minutes and you'll have perfect eggs, no sticking or breaking. The longer you cook the eggs, the harder the yolk will be. Hit them with salt and pepper to taste and that's it!
