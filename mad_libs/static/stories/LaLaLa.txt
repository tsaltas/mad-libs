Chiles are used in many local dishes, but they are used so inventively that their taste never palls. Dried chiles, sizzled in oil, give the "scorched chili flavor" that is the base of Kung Pao chicken and innumerable stir-fried vegetable dishes; combined with Sichuan pepper, they are used in the "hot-and-numbing" dishes that are so notoriously fiery. Milder chiles pickled in brine and spices yield a more subtle heat, the base of the sensational "fish-fragrant flavor" with its mix of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy tastes. Chili and fava bean paste is the dominant taste in "homestyle" dishes; and ground chiles and chili oil are used in a myriad of cold dishes, most famously the "strange-flavor" concoctions that combine salty, sweet, numbing, hot sour, and nutty tastes. The heat of chiles is never meant to overwhelm the flavors of the other ingredients, however, but to heighten sensation and to open up the palate to a rich variety of tastes.
